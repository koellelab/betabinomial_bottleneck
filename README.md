# betabinomial_bottleneck
Code for estimating transmission bottleneck sizes using the betabinomial approach 

The betabinomial approach for estimating transmission bottleneck sizes is described in:
Sobel Leonard et al. (2017) Journal of Virology. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00171-17
Transmission Bottleneck Size Estimation from Pathogen Deep-Sequencing Data, with an Application to Human Influenza A Virus

Here, we are providing both Matlab code and R code. Both sets of code include the mock (simulated) dataset that was used in the paper to test the apporach.
